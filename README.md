# Tic-Tac-toe-Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a two-player game where players take turns to make their moves and the game ends when one of the players has three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is filled with no winner.
